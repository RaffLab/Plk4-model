# Plk4-model

Matlab code to solve the ode and stochastic mathematical models for Plk4 oscillation

# Usage

main.m contains the code required to reproduce the figures. This function calls Plk4cycle.m and Plk4cycleStochastic.m which solve the ode and stochastic models respectively.

The .mat files contain the raw data shown in the figures, as well as the relevant parameter values for each figure.
